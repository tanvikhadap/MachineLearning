# SVM Implementation Comparison

## What is it?

This project demonstrates two approaches to implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier:
1. **Without Libraries:** A mathematical implementation of the SVM algorithm from scratch using basic Python constructs.
2. **With Libraries:** Implementation of SVM using scikit-learn's built-in `SVC` class, a widely used machine learning library.

The goal of this project is to show how the SVM algorithm works at a lower level, while also demonstrating the convenience and efficiency provided by machine learning libraries.

## Why should I make it?

Understanding the underlying math behind algorithms like SVM is essential for anyone interested in machine learning. By seeing both the manual and library-based implementation side by side, this project helps:
- Build a deeper understanding of how SVM works.
- Illustrate the importance of optimization provided by libraries.
  
Additionally, this README serves as documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the code, making it easier for others to understand and contribute.

## Who should make it?

This project is suitable for:
- Students and professionals who are learning or revisiting machine learning concepts.
- Developers interested in understanding how SVM operates behind the scenes.
- Anyone curious about algorithmic implementation and how it differs from using machine learning libraries.

## When should I make it?

Create this README before sharing the project with others, especially if you plan to make the project public. It’s good practice to include documentation right at the beginning so that anyone new to the project understands its purpose and usage quickly.

## Where should I put it?

Place this README in the top-level directory of the project repository, so that anyone visiting the project can easily find and understand what the project is about. If using GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, the README will be displayed automatically on the main project page.

## How should I make it?

This README is written in Markdown format. Markdown is widely used because it allows for lightweight formatting like headers, lists, and links, making it easy to read. You can write it using any text editor or Markdown editor like Visual Studio Code, Typora, or even use online editors like StackEdit.

## Project Structure

- **Mathematical SVM (Without Libraries):** This code implements the SVM algorithm manually, using gradient descent to find the optimal hyperplane for classification.
- **SVM with scikit-learn (With Libraries):** This code uses the `SVC` class from scikit-learn to classify the data, showcasing the power of optimized libraries in terms of speed and simplicity.

## How to Use

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project

1. **Load the Dataset**: 
   - The project uses a sample dataset (`car_data.csv`) with features like Age, Gender, Annual Salary, and whether the user purchased a product.

2. **Run the SVM Comparison**:
   - You can run the code to compare the two approaches. The code provides visualizations for the decision boundary of the SVM, allowing you to see the separation between classes.

## Conclusion

By implementing SVM manually and comparing it with scikit-learn’s SVM, this project highlights:
- The complexity of implementing algorithms from scratch.
- The efficiency and performance of libraries.
  
This is a great learning exercise for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of SVM and machine learning.
