# SVM Comparison: Library vs. Manual Implementation

## What is it?

This project compares two approaches for implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier:
1. **Manual SVM Implementation**: A step-by-step mathematical implementation of the SVM algorithm without using any external libraries.
2. **SVM Using Libraries**: Implementation of SVM using scikit-learn's `SVC` class for efficient and optimized computation.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how SVM works at a low level, while also showing the benefits of using a library for machine learning tasks.

## Why should I make it?

Creating this README helps explain the project to others, including:
- The purpose of the project.
- How to install and use it.
- How others can collaborate on the project.
  
This project can also be useful for those learning how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch, as well as for developers who want to understand the difference between manual implementation and using libraries like scikit-learn.

## Who should make it?

This README is for anyone who is working on the project and wants to:
- Share the project with others.
- Ensure that others can easily understand and use the project.
  
In particular, this README would be useful for students, developers, and machine learning enthusiasts.

## When should I make it?

It's best to create a README before sharing the project with others, especially if you plan to make it public. A well-documented project is easier to understand and contributes to the professionalism of the work.

## Where should I put it?

Place this README file in the top-level directory of your project. This is the standard location, and many platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) will display it on the projectâ€™s main page automatically.

## How should I make it?

This README is written in **Markdown** format, which is widely used for README files. Markdown allows for easy formatting with headers, lists, code blocks, and more. You can use any text editor to create it, or Markdown-specific editors like **Typora** or **Visual Studio Code**.

## Project Overview

This project compares two implementations of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification:

1. **SVM Without Libraries (Manual Implementation)**: 
   - Implemented from scratch using gradient descent and hyperplane optimization.
   - Manually calculates the weights and bias, and adjusts them iteratively.

2. **SVM With scikit-learn**: 
   - Uses the `SVC` class from the scikit-learn library for a streamlined and optimized implementation.
   - Demonstrates the power of using machine learning libraries in terms of simplicity and speed.

Both implementations are applied to a dataset (`car_data.csv`) with features such as Age, Gender, and Annual Salary, along with the target variable `Purchased`.

## How to Use

### Dependencies

To run the project, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project

1. **Load the Dataset**: The project uses a CSV file (`car_data.csv`) which contains the dataset for training and testing the SVM model.
   
2. **Run the SVM Implementations**:
   - **Manual SVM Implementation**: The code implements the SVM algorithm step by step and includes a function to calculate the decision boundary.
   - **SVM with scikit-learn**: The code uses scikit-learn's `SVC` class to implement the SVM model in a more efficient manner.

3. **Visualize the Results**: The project includes visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, which plot the data points and decision boundary for classification.

## Code Overview

### Manual SVM Implementation
The code manually computes the optimal hyperplane by:
- Initializing weights and bias.
- Iteratively adjusting them using gradient descent.
- Checking for correct classification based on margin constraints.

### SVM with scikit-learn
The `SVC` class from scikit-learn is used to train an SVM model with a linear kernel. The model is trained and tested using a simple train-test split.

## Results

- **Manual SVM**: This approach is more computationally intensive and requires more effort to implement, but it provides insight into the workings of the SVM algorithm.
- **SVM with Libraries**: The scikit-learn implementation is much faster and more convenient, allowing you to focus on data preparation and model tuning rather than algorithmic details.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of both the manual and library-based implementations of SVM. While manually implementing SVM helps understand its core functionality, using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn simplifies the process and enhances performance.

By running both approaches side by side, you can see the trade-offs between manually implementing machine learning algorithms and leveraging existing libraries.
