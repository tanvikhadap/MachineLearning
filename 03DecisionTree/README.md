# Decision Tree Implementation: From Scratch vs Using Libraries

## What is it?
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier in two ways:
1. **From scratch**: Building a decision tree without using any external libraries.
2. **Using libraries**: Utilizing Python’s `scikit-learn` library to implement a decision tree classifier.

It aims to compare the two approaches in terms of accuracy and performance while highlighting the differences in the implementation process.

## Why should I make it?
If you're interested in learning how machine learning models like decision trees work under the hood, this project is for you. It provides a practical comparison of how decision trees can be manually constructed step by step versus how library implementations automate this process. Understanding both methods can help in building a deeper comprehension of the algorithms and also how to use pre-built tools efficiently.

## Who should make it?
This project is ideal for:
- Machine learning enthusiasts
- Data scientists
- Students or professionals looking to understand decision trees from both theoretical and practical standpoints.

## When should I make it?
You should make a README file for this project as soon as you start working on it, especially if you intend to share the project or collaborate with others. It will help others (and yourself in the future) understand what the project does and how to run it.

## Where should I put it?
The README file should be placed in the top-level directory of your project. If you're using a code hosting platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, this will be the first file users see when they visit your repository.

## How should I make it?
This README is written in **Markdown**, a simple yet powerful text formatting language. Below is a breakdown of how this project works

## Code Explanation

### Decision Tree from Scratch
The `decision_tree_scratch.py` file demonstrates:
- **Gini Index Calculation**: Measures the "impurity" of the dataset.
- **Dataset Splitting**: Recursively splits the dataset based on the feature that minimizes the Gini index.
- **Tree Building**: Recursively builds the decision tree by creating branches and leaf nodes.
- **Prediction**: Classifies new samples based on the constructed tree.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Compares predicted vs actual values and computes the accuracy of the model.

### Decision Tree Using `scikit-learn`
The `decision_tree_libraries.py` file shows:
- **Model Training**: Using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed to assess performance.
- **Visualization**: The decision tree is plotted using `plot_tree` from `scikit-learn` for better understanding.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 
  - Scratch Implementation: 100%
  - Library Implementation: 91.5%

The accuracy values will vary based on the dataset and specific parameters used. In general, the library-based implementation is faster and more efficient due to optimized algorithms and parallel processing.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the differences between manually building a decision tree and using `scikit-learn`’s implementation. While writing the tree from scratch provides in-depth knowledge of how the algorithm works, using libraries is more practical for larger datasets and real-world applications.
