# Random Forest Implementation: From Scratch vs Using Libraries

## What is it?
This project compares two implementations of the Random Forest algorithm
1. **From scratch:** A simplified version of Random Forest implemented without using any libraries.
2. **Using libraries:** Implementing Random Forest using `scikit-learn`.

The project demonstrates how multiple decision trees are used in ensemble learning to make more accurate predictions.

## Why should I make it?
This project helps explain how Random Forest works, from bootstrapping the data, building multiple decision trees, and aggregating their predictions. Comparing both methods will deepen your understanding of the Random Forest algorithm, and help you recognize when to rely on libraries for efficient computations.

## Who should make it?
This project is useful for
- Machine learning learners
- Data scientists who want to understand Random Forests in detail
- Those who want to explore ensemble learning techniques and their implementations.

## When should I make it?
A README should be created as soon as the project is shared with others or made public. It helps collaborators or future users understand the project, its purpose, and how to use it.

## Where should I put it?
Place the README file in the root directory of your project repository. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket will automatically display the README when someone visits the repository.

## How should I make it?
This README is written in **Markdown**, a simple formatting language. Below is a detailed explanation of how the project works.

## Code Explanation

### Random Forest from Scratch
The `random_forest_scratch.py` file demonstrates:
- **Bootstrapping**: Multiple datasets are sampled with replacement.
- **Decision Tree Construction**: Each tree is trained on a separate dataset sample.
- **Prediction Aggregation**: Predictions from individual decision trees are combined using an averaging method (for regression) or majority voting (for classification).

This script illustrates how multiple decision trees work together to improve the overall prediction performance, emulating the Random Forest ensemble technique.

### Random Forest Using `scikit-learn`
The `random_forest_libraries.py` file shows:
- **Model Training**: A Random Forest classifier is trained using `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using train-test splits to measure performance.
- **Prediction**: Predictions are aggregated by majority vote across multiple decision trees in the forest.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a Random Forest works and compares the implementation complexity of building it from scratch vs. using the optimized `scikit-learn` library. Understanding both approaches provides valuable insight into the underlying mechanics of ensemble learning and how libraries optimize such algorithms.
