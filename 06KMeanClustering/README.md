# K-Means Clustering Implementation: From Scratch vs Using Libraries

## What is it?
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm in two ways:
1. **From scratch**: Manually implementing the K-Means algorithm without any external libraries.
2. **Using libraries**: Utilizing Pythonâ€™s `scikit-learn` library to implement the K-Means algorithm.

The project compares both approaches to highlight how K-Means works mathematically and how to use pre-built functions for efficiency in real-world scenarios.

## Why should I make it?
The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand how the K-Means clustering algorithm operates.
- Compare manual implementation with a library-based approach to appreciate the differences in effort and efficiency.
- Apply clustering to explore patterns in data without requiring labels (unsupervised learning).

## Who should make it?
This project is intended for:
- Data science students or enthusiasts.
- Machine learning practitioners.
- Anyone interested in unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms.

## When should I make it?
This README should be created when you are ready to share or publish the project, providing an overview and documentation for users or collaborators.

## Where should I put it?
Place the README file in the top-level directory of your project repository. This ensures anyone new to the project can quickly understand its purpose and usage.

## How should I make it?
The README is written in **Markdown** format, which is easy to write and read, especially on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

## Code Explanation

### K-Means from Scratch
The `kmeans_scratch.py` file demonstrates:
- **Random Centroid Initialization**: Centroids are selected randomly from the dataset.
- **Cluster Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.
- **Centroid Movement**: Centroids are updated as the mean of all assigned data points.
- **Convergence Check**: The algorithm stops when centroids no longer change.

### K-Means Using `scikit-learn`
The `kmeans_libraries.py` file shows:
- **KMeans Model**: Using `KMeans` from `scikit-learn` for clustering.
- **Elbow Method**: Determining the optimal number of clusters by plotting within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
- **Silhouette Score**: A metric used to assess the quality of clustering by measuring how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

## Results

### Visualization:
Scatter plots visualize how the data points are clustered based on the K-Means algorithm.

- **K-Means from Scratch**: Data points are plotted based on their clusters and centroid positions are updated over iterations.
- **K-Means Using `scikit-learn`**: The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters and the silhouette score evaluates the performance of the clustering model.

### Silhouette Score:
- Scratch Implementation: 0.6282588553070034
- Library Implementation: 0.6282588238797112

## Conclusion

This project illustrates both the complexity and value of manually implementing K-Means, as well as the efficiency of using library functions like `KMeans` from `scikit-learn`. Both approaches yield similar results, but the library-based approach is significantly faster and easier to implement, especially for large datasets.
